# Total SQL Recall

Total SQL Recall is (was) a SQL Server add-in, originally written for SQL Server 2005 and 2008. 

I stopped using SQL Server a few months after writing it.

Years later, I briefly tried to get it working with SQL Server 2008 R2, but never managed. I haven't even tried with SQL Server 2012 or 2014.

More details of the add-in can be found in the original [blog post](http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/jonsayce/archive/2008/01/14/Total-SQL-Recall.aspx), and in another blog post describing [how it was done](http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/jonsayce/archive/2008/01/15/building-a-sql-server-management-studio-addin.aspx).
